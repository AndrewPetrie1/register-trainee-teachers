  title: You no longer need to provide a lead or employing school for trainees who are funded or employed privately
  content: >-
    When you’re registering a trainee, we were asking for a lead or employing school in all cases. If a trainee is funded or employed privately, we do not need this information so we’ve added a ‘not applicable’ option to the lead and employing schools sections. You do not need to provide lead or employing schools if the trainee is funded or employed privately.
