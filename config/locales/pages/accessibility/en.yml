        <p class='govuk-body'>This service is run by the Becoming a Teacher team at the Department for Education.
          We want as many people as possible to be able to use the service. For example, that means users should be able to:
        </p>

        <ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
          <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
          <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
          <li>navigate most of the service using just a keyboard</li>
          <li>navigate most of the service using speech recognition software</li>
          <li>
            listen to most of the content on the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS,
            NVDA and VoiceOver)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class='govuk-body'>We’ve also made the text on the service as simple as possible to understand.</p>

        <p class='govuk-body'>
          The Becoming a Teacher team (DfE) is committed to making Register trainee teachers accessible,
          in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility
          Regulations 2018.
        </p>

        <p class='govuk-body'>
          The service was designed using the <a class='govuk-link' href='https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/'>GOV.UK Design System</a>,

          we are currently arranging an accessibility audit. We will update this page following the audit,
          and publish details of any accessibility issues identified.
